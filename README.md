For personal study purpose, I am implementing TSP heuristics:
GA-EAX (GA with Edge Assembly Crossover) and CLK (Chained Lin-Kernighan).

Some codes in src/ are apapted from GA-EAX by Yuichi Nagata
and Concorde by Applegate, Bixby, Chvatal, and Cook.

Original codes in archive/ are downloaded from "github.com/nagata-yuichi/GA-EAX"
and "www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde/downloads/codes/src/co031219.tgz".

Papers in doc/ are referenced to implement these TSP heuristics.

The instances of TSP problems are .tsp files in instances/, which is a widespread format.
